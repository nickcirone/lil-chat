Lil Chat, A simple server-client chat application
Created by Nicholas Cirone, 7/11/18 - Present

Lil Chat is built using node, express, and socket.io on the server side and javascript/jquery on the front-end.
In the near future I plan on using the Vue framework to flesh out the front-end and I also plan to implement additional
functionality, such as a list of all clients active on the server and the ability to send direct messages between clients.

Node.js must be installed locally to run the program. Once installed, navigate to the repo directory and run "node index.js".
Clients can connect to the server on localhost at port 3000, the default port for express.js web apps.
